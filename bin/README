This directory is intended for containing temporary files used by rnamotif, nupack, pknots etc.
In addition it by default contains the nupack executable.

In the case of a machine which is not running architecture dependant executables,
one should fine here:
Fold.out.nopairs
Fold.out.boot.nopairs

For a box with arch dependant exes
Fold.out.nopairs.$arch
Fold.out.boot.nopairs.$arch
