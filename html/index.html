  Cis-acting mRNA elements that program ribosomes to shift
  translational reading frame were first discovered in viruses. These
  programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) signals are composed of
  a heptameric "slippery site" followed by an mRNA pseudoknot
  secondary structure.

 <a href="html/viral.png">Viruses</a>
 typically use -1 PRF as a genome condensation strategy;
 enabling them to encode multiple proteins from a single unaltered
 mRNA. Historically, because of their relative simplicity, many
 molecular regulatory elements have been first discovered in viruses:
 -1 PRF is no different.
    </p>

    <p>
 We developed a computational method to identify putative -1 PRF
 signals in eukaryotic genomic sequences. Subsets of these sequences
 were shown to stimulate significant -1 programmed frameshifting using
 dual-luciferase reporter constructs.

    </p>

    <p>
 Analysis of these signals suggests that, after a frameshifting event,
 ribosomes would be directed to translate premature termination
 codons. These should promote mRNA destabilization via the
 nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. We previously showed that
 a viral -1 PRF signal cloned in a similar context can function as an
 mRNA destabilizing element.
<font size=-1><a href="#cis_acting"><sup>3</sup></a></font>
 This suggests that regulation of  -1 PRF may be used to regulate cellular
 gene expression by controlling mRNA stability. In addition, ribosome
 stalling induced by strong mRNA structures can also promote mRNA
 degradation via 'No-go decay,' suggesting that our computational
 approach may be capable of identifying a class of mRNA destabilizing
 elements independent of -1 PRF.

  This online database is focused on cataloging programmed
  ribosomal frameshift signals (PRF) in eukaryotic genomes.
  Please search for a gene of interest or select one of the
  links above to get started.  Most of the sequence information from
  this database came from either the
   <a href="http://yeastgenome.org">Yeast Genome Project</a>
  or the
   <a href="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov">Mammalian Gene Collection</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
  It is possible to search for any word(s) from the NCBI or SGD gene
  description as well as the canonical gene name.  Thus searching for
  'RPL' or 'ribosome' are likely candidates for looking at ribosomal
  genes.
