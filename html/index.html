  <b>Welcome!</b>

<p>
  This online database is focused on cataloging programmed
  ribosomal frameshift signals (PRF) in eukaryotic genomes.<br>
  Please search for a gene of interest or select one of the
  links above to get started.<br>
  Most of the sequence information from this database came
  from either the <a href="http://yeastgenome.org">Yeast Genome Project</a>
  or the <a href="http://mgc.nci.nih.gov">Mammalian Gene Collection</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, there are [% cerevisiae_count %] entries from
  <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, [% sapiens_count %] entries from
  <i>Homo sapiens</i>, and [% musculus_count %] entries from
  <i>Mus musculus</i>.  The last update to the database was a <i>[% last_species %]</i>
   sequence at [% lastupdate %].
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to search for any word(s) from the NCBI or SGD gene
  description as well as the canonical gene name.  Thus searching for
  'RPL' or 'ribosome' are likely candidates for looking at ribosomal
  genes.
