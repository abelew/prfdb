  Once a single gene is identified of interest, it may be examined
  using the 'genome' interface.  This page provides some general
  information about the gene, its name, the number of foldings
  completed in the PRFdb thus far, and the locations of in frame
  slippery sites.  There is a view of the sequence window showing the
  start codon, stop codon, and potential prf signals.<br>
  It is possible from here to 
  <a href="[% base %]/help_blast">blast</a> the currently viewed gene
  against all genes in the PRFdb or against the NCBI NR database.  It
  is also possible to look at the minimume free energy
  <a href="[% base %]/help_landscape">landscape</a> of the gene.
