  Most information is kept on the 'detail' page.  Once a particular
  gene and putative PRF site has been chosen, it is possible to view
  some more specific information about that PRF signal here.<br>
  Each group of information concerns one folding performed for the
  given PRF signal.  Thus we see once again the gene's name, species,
  accession, and position.<br>
  The 'algorithm' field specifies which minimum free energy folding
  program was used to fold this specific sequence window.<br>
  'Barcode' provides a shorthand notation to quickly identify how many
  stems exist in the putative secondary structure and how they are
  oriented.  In this notation, a simple stem is '11' and a H-type
  pseudoknot is '1212'.<br>
  'Sequence length' and 'Slippery site' provide some information about
  the context of the given sequence window.<br>
  'Base pairs' and 'MFE' show the measurements provided by the mimimum
  free energy heuristics of the given prediction algorithm.<br>
  'Z score,' 'Randomized Mean MFE,' and 'PPCC' provide some
  statistical information about how this particular sequence window
  compares to a distribution of randomized sequences folded in a
  similar fashion.<br>
  'Z score' is defined as (Actual mfe - the mean mfe of the randomized
  sequences) / the standard deviation of the randomized sequences.
  As a result, the more negative a given Z score is, the more
  interesting it should prove.<br>
  PPCC is a measurement which can give a sense of how likely the Z
  score is to be useful.  A Z score assumes its data is normally
  distributed.  The PPCC provides a measurement of how close to
  'normal' a given set of values actually is.<br>
  These last few fields are summarized in the graph on the right side
  of the table.  This bar graph shows a series of 'bins' and what
  percentage of the randomized sequences have minimum free energies
  falling into each 'bin.'  A red line provides a guide to how many
  entries one would expect in each bin if the minimum free energy
  values were normally distributed.  The green line shows where on
  this distribution the actual minimum free energy lies.  If the
  actual MFE is more negative than the mean of the distribution of
  random values, that is a good sign for the significance of the
  putative PRF signal.<br>
  Below this graph lies a sequence view, and a few ways to visualize
  the putative mRNA secondary structure, including a bracket notation,
  a numeric stem diagram, and a linear feynman image.<br>
