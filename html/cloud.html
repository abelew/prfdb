The x axis displays the range of putative <a href="[% base %]/help_detail#help_mfe">
minimum free energy</a> values computed for all [% species %]
sequences of length [% seqlength %].<br>
The y axis displays the range of <a href="[% base %]/help_detail#help_z">
z scores</a> for these same sequences.<br>
Each dot thus represents a single (mfe, z score) in relation to all
the others for [% species %].  The black lines delineate the mean mfe
and z score for this population.  Grey dots thus represent sequence
windows which have less putative secondary structure than the mean
<b>and</b> are less structured than their randomized counterparts, as
such these are unlikely to be of interest.  Green dots have a minimum
free energy less than the mean, but are less structured than their
randomized counterparts while the opposite is true of blue dots.  Red
dots are more significant than the mean in both respects.  Grey lines
delineate standard deviations less than mean.  Darker dots represent
coordinates wihch share more than 1 sequence window.
