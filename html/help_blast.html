 <p>
  There are two main ways to access BLAST in the PRFdb.  When looking
  at the sequence of a particular gene, it is possible to perform a
  local or NR blast.  A local blast should find any sequences in the
  PRFdb which are similar to the sequence window of interest while a
  remote blast provides a listing of genes from NR which are similar.
  If desired, these accessions may be imported into the PRFdb for
  examination later.
