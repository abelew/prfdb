  There are two main ways to access BLAST in the PRFdb.  When looking
  at the sequence of a particular gene, it is possible to perform a
  BLAST search against all entries in the PRFdb or a remote search against
  the NR database.  Currently, this only allows one to use the default
  BLAST options.  When using the NR search, it is possible to import the
  resulting sequences into the PRFdb for later examination.  Sequences imported
  in this fashion are added to a queue to be searched as soon as possible.
