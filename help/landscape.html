  The 'landscape' is generated by performing a fast folding of many
  sequence windows for a given gene.  By default, this is done using
  105 base pair sequence windows every 15 nucleotides.  Thus any given
  position in the ORF is folded 7 times.  The graph that is generated
  from this information provides green and red lines for the start and
  stop codons respectively and black lines for each putative PRF
  signal.  It is hypothesized that a PRF signal of significance should
  be in the midst of a significant decrease of minimum free energy.
