  The 'cloud' provides an amusing way to visualize all the sequences
  of the database for a given species.  Once a species is chosen, an
  image-map plot is created showing the Z-score with respect to
  Minimum Free Energy for every entry in the database (with some
  limits).  The horizontal black line shows the mean Z score of all
  sequences in the current set while the vertical line shows the mean
  MFE.  For the purposes of the PRFdb, it is unlikely that sequences
  with MFEs or Zscores greater than the mean are of interest, thus all
  the fun sequences are colored red.  Grey lines provide a measurement
  of one standard deviation more fun than mean.  Darker dots mean more
  sequence windows share a given MFE,Zscore coordinate.  Clicking a
  dot brings up a quick summary of all sequence windows which share
  that MFe,Zscore coordinate.
