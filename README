This is a README file, there are many like it, but this is my own.

Start with an explanation of the database and its schemas.
The primary key for everything lies in the genome table.
GENOME:
Id Acccession Species Genename Version Comment Mrna_seq Protein_seq Orf_start Orf_stop Lastupdate
  Id is auto-incremented.  Genename must be parsed out of the input database and so is not as
  reliable as comment.  mrna_seq is the full sequence given.  protein_seq comes from the cds
  annotation.  orf_start and orf_stop define what range we will look at later.
Problems:
  1)  This table is filled with 1 full copy of the genomic sequence (mrna_seq) for every
      orf in the sequence, this is annoying for viral genomes.

QUEUE
Id Genome_id Public Params Out Done
  Each id is unique, but the genome_id will be used to pull the sequence
  SELECT id, genome_id, params where public='1' order by rand() limit 1
  SELECT id, genome_id, params where done='0' order by rand() limit 1
  should pull the parameters and genome for a random one
  UPDATE queue set out='1' where id='xxx'
  UPDATE queue set done='1' where id='xxx'
  should tell the database that a given sequence is finished

RNAMOTIF
id genome_id species accession start total permissable filedata output lastupdate
  Each id should be unique, but genome_id will come from the genome table.
  So, in order to get all the rnamotif information for a given accession and region one would
  SELECT * from rnamotif where genome_id='123'
  But if you want all ORFs for an accession
  SELECT * from rnamotif where accession='1234'

NUPACK/PKNOTS/ETC
Id Genome_id Species Accession Start Slipsite Seqlength Sequence Output Parsed Mfe Pairs Knotp Barcode Lastupdate
  Same ideas apply.  The only time the Accession should be duplicated is when you have
   a)  Multiple slippery sites per transcript
   b)  Multiple ORFs per transcript

BOOT
ID Genome_id Species Accession Start Iterations Rand_method Mfe_method Mfe_mean Mfe_Sd Mfe_Se Pairs_mean Pairs_sd Pairs_se Mfe_values Lastupdate

DERIVED
ID Mfe_source Mfe_id Boot_id Accession Image Z_score Lastupdate
Mfe_source is the source table, mfe_id is the id in that table, boot_id is the id from boot
