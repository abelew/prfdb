1. Fix Parser (PkParse.pm) 20051207
    a bug was found where the parser was incrementing stems when it should not have been. Check out in the prfdb05 database, pknots table, compare ID#'s 122193 and 122577. They should be the same (i.e. the parsed structures should be the same; hence the barcodes should be as well).
