Required Software that isn't likely to be in your distribution:
rnamotif
pknots
nupack
hotknots
ViennaRNA

The list of required perl modules may be found in lib/MyDeps.pm
It makes an attempt to auto-install anything that is missing.
If it fails, you can run perl -MCPAN -e shell
then install 'missing_module' in order to get yourself squared away. 

Required Editing:
Set PRFDB_HOME in your apache configuration, check the file
apache/xprfdb.conf for more details
If you are running a web server you will also need to set
PRFDB_NAME and PRFDB_IP

Copy prfdb.conf.default to prfdb.conf
The fields for database_user, database_pass etc need to be changed.
Most other settings are fine by default, but you can change pretty much
anything from the configuration file if you desire.

Finally:
Run ./prf_daemon --setup_db

You can test your installation with:
./prf_daemon --shell

If it worked, you can do a show tables and see all the initial tables.
At that point, you will likely want to import some sequences.
./prf_daemon --import needs to be documented...
